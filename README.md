## Overview

The **Auto Causal Inference Assistant for Banking** is designed to simplify the process of causal inference in banking scenarios. This tool leverages **LangGraph** and **MCP** to provide a robust framework for understanding relationships and impacts within financial data. With this repository, you can easily implement causal inference techniques, helping banks make data-driven decisions.

## Features

- **Automated Causal Analysis**: Quickly assess causal relationships in your banking data.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive commands and structures make it easy to use.
- **Integration with LangGraph**: Utilize powerful graph-based methods for causal inference.
- **Support for MCP**: Incorporate multiple causal pathways in your analysis.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large datasets typical in banking environments.

## Installation

To install the Auto Causal Inference Assistant, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Amadou427/auto-causal-inference.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd auto-causal-inference
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

After installation, you can start using the tool. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to perform causal inference.

### Basic Command

To run a causal analysis, use the following command:
```bash
python main.py --data your_data_file.csv --output results.json
```

Replace `your_data_file.csv` with your actual data file and `results.json` with your desired output filename.

### Advanced Options

You can customize your analysis with various options:
- `--method`: Specify the causal inference method (e.g., `do-calculus`, `propensity-score`).
- `--visualize`: Generate visualizations of causal graphs.
- `--config`: Load a configuration file for advanced settings.

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Causal Inference

Suppose you have a dataset that includes customer transactions and account types. You can analyze how account types influence transaction amounts. Hereâ€™s how you would run the analysis:

```bash
python main.py --data transactions.csv --method do-calculus --output transaction_analysis.json
```

### Example 2: Visualization of Causal Graph

To visualize the causal relationships, you can run:

```bash
python main.py --data transactions.csv --visualize --output causal_graph.png
```

This will create a visual representation of the causal relationships in your dataset.
